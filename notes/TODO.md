#Todo

###Priorities
* Continue to create samples of all important existing markup tags and syntax
* Switch to Yard, strengthen this app
    * Consider making this a new gem called something like marskal_app_standards or marskal_ruby_app_standards
    * Make classes for yard and rdoc separately
    * Add Rails standards as well
    * API standards
    * Look at other yard gems    
    * In yard samples make functions have params and attributes and such    
* Write Tests
* Get on Wiki
* Publish Gem
* Add bin files and make work on windows
* Test on Windows and Linux
* Get working on Travis

###Future Features
* Create a Standard module to be used as a guide or template for documenting our code
    * Use simple dice game of standard blog app
